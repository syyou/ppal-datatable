            <small>
                Your booking is a request to us to reserve a place for you on a course with a specific start date (“course start date”) and duration, including any optional extras such as seminar or chosen by you.
                All class material are subject to acceptance by us.
                After placing an order, you will receive an email or letter from us acknowledging that we have received and accept your order (the “order confirmation”).
                The order confirmation shall include a copy of these terms and conditions (“the contract”).
                The contract will only be formed when we send you the order confirmation.
                By accepting the specific course start date you hereby accept that delivery of the course may fall outside of the 30 day delivery window from the date of the order confirmation.
                The contract will relate only to those courses and chosen course options which we have confirmed we will provide in the order confirmation. The value of the contract will be the sum of the tuition fee and any course options (“the course fee”).
                You warrant that all information provided to us by you for the purposes of the contract is complete and accurate.
